From there, Tony meets up with an old friend, Michiko, and they travel to Kisoji for a water purification ritual; learn the exchange of meishi and help celebrate Obon. Later, Tony attends a Hanshin Tigers game. \n In China, a country Tony has never visited, he attempts to tackle as much of its cuisine and culture as he can in a short period of time. Beijing is Tony's first stop, where he samples Peking duck, the nasty bits of a sheep, and a variety of noodles at a noodle house. Tony gets a lesson in Chinese calligraphy and visits a doctor for some traditional Chinese medicine such as acupuncture, fire cupping, and electroacupuncture. From there, Tony is off to Sichuan province, where he receives an unorthodox ear cleaning, visits the Jianfu Temple, center of Taoism during the Tang dynasty, and samples Szechuan hotpot. He ends his visit in a village outside of Chengdu for a family dinner that uses the old methods of Chinese cooking."
